# horst-package
This is a collection of functions used by me and my colleagues in [Pschological Diagnostics](https://www.psychologie.hu-berlin.de/de/personal/91680294) at Humboldt-University of Berlin.

Until now, there are only very few functions and most of them are tailored to a specific problem, relying on input from specific functions from other packages (see respective help-pages).

Note: Dependencies need to be installed and loaded manually!


- **corHist** A histogram of correlations on level-1 and level-2.
- **omegaW** A function to compute Omega's W.
- **simpsonCor** A plot that allows discovering the Simpsons Paradox.
- **getTable** A function that produces a correlation table in Excel which is close enough to an APA correlation table for further editing.
- **matchItems** Based on the `psych` package, this function adds items from a codebook to the result of an efa.
- **plotMod** Plots an interaction on three dimensions, one being coloured dots.
- **renameCodebook** Using a codebook (for example from excel), function changes names in a data set according to the codebook.
- **findMis** finds missing data (or other entries that can be specified) in any given data set.
- **vlookup** An immplementation of the VLOOKUP function from Excel.
- **lmerSimple** A function to run lmer-models from character strings.
- **lmerPlottt** A function to plot *t*-values of fixed effects from `lmer`-models
- **tStats** A function to extract *t*-statistics (*t*, *df*, *p*) from a t.test to plot it, use it in word or latex.
- **withinFun** Apply a function to each entry in a nested data frame, i. e. compute the mean of a measurement for each subject in a longitudinal study.
- **nestedAlpha** A function to compute alpha for nested scales, for example in multilevel data.

## Installing the package:

Run the following code lines:

```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("kthorstmann/horst")
```



```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "README-"
)
```
